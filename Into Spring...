   J2EE :
=========
Spring is used "EJB" Technology.
EJB(Enterprise java Beans)
It is  used to developing websites like Enterprised level.

FOR A SPRING JDBC :
===================
1. Get access to *jdbc Template*.
2. Prepare and execute an Sql query.
3. Gather and process result.


===================================
 Spring mainly supports 2 concepts
1) coding to interfaces is perfect. 
 >By using of interfaces we can make objects as loosely  coupled.
2)Spring is used Plain Old Java Object(POJO).
what is POJO class?
A class doesn't derive any other class and the variables must having the setters and getters then we called as POJO.

Ex:
public class POJOClass
{
private String message;
public String getMessage()
{
return this.message;
}
public void setMessage(String message)
{
this.message=message;
}
}

===================================
Spring is a
 >LightWeight - used only minimum funtionalities
 >Aspect-oriented - by the updation of content it doesn't affect on previous 
 >Inversion of control(IoC) - The responsibility of injection was taken  by the 3rd party.
 >Dependency injection framework - cooneccting and wrapping data at runtime.

 Note : Inversion of control(IoC) &  Dependency injection framework are used to make object as loose coupling.
Ex:
Tightly coupled
================
 Class AirtelSim
{

}
class JioSim
{

}

class Mobile
{
Mobile()
{
AirtelSim ar= new AirtelSim();
}
}

  >>Here objects of Mobile&AirtelSim are tightly Coupled Now.

Now by using of Spring to make it as loosely coupled using interfaces.
======================================================================
Ex:
interface Sim
{

}
class AirtelSim implements Sim
{

}
class JioSim implements Sim
{

}

Class Mobile
{
Sim s;
}
   >> Now Objects of Mobile & Sim are loosely coupled because we can pass/inject any object (AirtelSim/JioSim) of the subclasses of the sim interface at rumtime.
