Spring Boot is an open-source Java framework that makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-ready Spring-based applications. It reduces boilerplate code and configuration by providing built-in defaults, embedded servers (like Tomcat/Jetty), and a wide range of starter templates. With Spring Boot, developers can quickly develop, test, and deploy applications with minimal setup while still maintaining flexibility and control.
