Spring Boot is an open-source Java framework that makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-ready Spring-based applications. 
It reduces boilerplate code and configuration by providing built-in defaults, embedded servers (like Tomcat/Jetty), and a wide range of starter templates. 
With Spring Boot, developers can quickly develop, test, and deploy applications with minimal setup while still maintaining flexibility and control.

Advantages:
-----------
Auto-configuration – Automatically configures beans and settings based on dependencies in the classpath.
===================
Spring Boot Starters – Predefined dependency packages to simplify setup (e.g., spring-boot-starter-web).
=====================
Embedded Servers – No need to deploy WAR files; apps run directly with embedded Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow.
===============
Production-Ready Features – Includes health checks, metrics, logging, and monitoring tools.
=========================
Minimal Configuration – "Convention over configuration" approach reduces boilerplate.
